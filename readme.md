A repository where I collect my experiments with JAX.

Implementation of matrix free jacobian-vector products for QR-decomposition, Cholesky factorization, and bidiagonalization. These are needed for efficient forward-mode automatic differentiation.

Next up are vector-jacobian products of the above, needed for reverse-mode automatic differentiation.
